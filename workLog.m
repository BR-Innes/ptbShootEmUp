% Work on 'Building Blocks' for the game: 
% 1. Fixed up the movement to allow diagonal movement ('moveSquare.m') 
% 2. Draw starry background ('starfieldBackground.m')
    % May need to fix the arrays so I don't have to use >> []' 
% 3. Draw score ('drawScore.m')
% 4. Worked on bullet ('bulletTest.m') 
    % Same problem with >> []'

% A lot of problems trying to loop the audio; not able to use 'play(handle)' in a loop
% Will look into PTB solution
